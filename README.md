# homebridge-webos-tv

`homebridge-webos-tv` is a plugin for HomeBridge which allows you to control your webOS TV! It should work with all TVs that support webOS2 and newer.
The idea is that the TV should be controlled completely from the native HomeKit iOS app and Siri, that is why volume appears as a light bulb or external input as a switch.

### IMPORTANT

#### The old package ```homebridge-webos3``` is deprecated. New development will be made here. If you used the old package please change your accessory in your config.json to ```webostv``` and install this new package!

### Features
* Power status
* Turn on / off
* Mute Status (as light bulb)
* Mute / Unmute (as light bulb)
* Volume control (as light bulb and switches)
* Open apps (switch between apps of your choice and live tv)
* Channel control
* Media control
* Show notifications

## Installation

If you are new to Homebridge, please first read the Homebridge [documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/homebridge).
If you are running on a Raspberry, you will find a tutorial in the [homebridge-punt Wiki](https://github.com/cflurin/homebridge-punt/wiki/Running-Homebridge-on-a-Raspberry-Pi).

Install homebridge:
```sh
sudo npm install -g homebridge
```

Install homebridge-webos-tv:
```sh
sudo npm install -g homebridge-webos-tv
```

## Configuration

Add the accessory in `config.json` in your home directory inside `.homebridge`.

```js
{
  "accessories": [
    {
      "accessory": "webostv",
      "name": "My webOS tv",
      "ip": "192.168.0.40",
      "mac": "ab:cd:ef:fe:dc:ba",
      "keyFile": "/home/pi/.homebridge/lgtvKeyFile",
      "volumeControl": "switch",
      "mediaControl": false,
      "pollingInterval": 10,
      "appSwitch":[
         "com.webos.app.tvguide",
         "youtube.leanback.v4",
         "com.webos.app.hdmi2",
         "com.webos.app.externalinput.component"
      ],
      "channelButtons": [3,5,7,8],
      "notificationButtons": [
         "Motion detected - living room",
         "Motion detected - kitchen"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

You also need to enable **mobile tv on** on your tv for the turn on feature to work correctly.

On newer TVs **LG Connect Apps** under the network settings needs to be enabled.

### Configuration fields
- `accessory` [required]
Should always be "webostv"
- `name` [required]
Name of your accessory
- `ip` [required]
ip address of your tv
- `mac` [required]
Mac address of your tv
- `wolIp` [optional]
Wake-on-LAN address. If homebridge runs on a host with more than one network address/interface/LAN, the WoL address should be set to the broadcast address of the network the TV is on, so that the WoL packet is sent to the proper LAN. I.e. if the TV address is 192.168.0.40, the broadcast address should likely to be set to 192.168.0.255. **Default: 255.255.255.255**
- `keyFile` [optional]
To prevent the tv from asking for permission when you reboot homebridge, specify a file path to store the permission token. If the file doesn't exist it'll be created. Don't specify a directory or you'll get an `EISDIR` error.
- `pollingInterval` [optional]
The TV state background polling interval in seconds. **Default: 5**
- `volumeControl` [optional]
Wheter the volume control service is enabled. **Default: true**
Available values:

  - Apps can also be started when the TV is off, in that case an attempt to power on the TV and switch to the chosen app will be made
- `channelButtons` [optional]
